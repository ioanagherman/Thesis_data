This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in the PhD thesis of Ioana Gherman submitted at the University of Bristol. The corresponding data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17843913.

The code from the wcm2024 folder is based on the E. coli WCM model published by the Covert lab at Stanford University that was enhanced to allow the modelling of exogenous metabolic pathways
